Jay Wang's COMP 20 Spring 2013 Repo

1. This repo is a private repo used for the COMP 20 Web Programming class at Tufts University CS Dept.
This repo was used during the Spring 2013 semester.

2. My favorite project for the class is the assignment 4 that included a game of Frogger.
This was very interesting to learn and even more fun to play with after finishing the assignment.

3. I am most proud of the Frogger assignment, I feel that it is something that people can play with
and interact with a lot.

4. I have learned a lot from this class. Although I knew some web design before coming into the class,
learning the programming aspects of websites was a rewarding experience that will come handy for a long
time to come, since the online market is prevalent these days and will be in the future.

Loved the course and definitely gained some knowledge about web development.
