<a name="introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This app provides web games to log scores into their database and it keeps track 
of fields such as username, game title, score, and date the score was logged. 
It uses many different APIs such as allowing games to post their scores and 
allowing searches to be made on the usernames.</p>

<a name="methodology"></a><h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>To find security issues with the ScoreCenter app, one of the main tools used
was the source code itself, which was provided by Caleb Malchik.</p>
<p>To test the application, Nodejs and other software was needed and then
using a localhost enviornment we ran the app and tried different attacks.</p>
<p>We tried to use some other software/security tools, but they were not helpful
enough to contribute anything.</p>

<a name="findings"></a><h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>The main findings of the security issues in ScoreCenter include (1) an API 
that clears the ENTIRE database, (2) allowing access from any place without
checking the connections' identities, and (3) input field that allows 
the user to put whatever they want.</p>
<ol>
<li><h2>'/clear' API</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anyone can clear the database if they know about the API so the database loses
value/persistence.</li>
<li>Does not ask for confirmation even though the results of this API is extremely 
important and can cause a lot of issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li><h2>Allow all to access the APIs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anyone or any site can use the API, which is great that it's so open source, 
but it kind of lets malicious users have a lot of freedom in messing with the 
app and that causes trouble for other users who actually value the app and want to 
use it for its resources.</li>
<li>Data in a database should be safe but also meaningful, and that might not be 
the case if all data from anywhere is allowed into the database without any 
checks or filtering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li><h2>Unrestricted user input</h2>
<ul>
<li>One of the APIs shows a page with a text box and a submit button but it is not 
limited in how much the user can type in.</li>
<li>Attackers can type malicious code to attack this security fault and corrupt the 
app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<a name="issues"></a><h1>Issues Found</h1>
<ol>
<li><h2>'/Clear' API problem</h2></li>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">Location: </span>web.js</li>
<li><span class="emph">Severity: </span><span class="high">HIGH</span> - Anyone can clear the database...</li>
<li><span class="emph">Description: </span>The GET '/clear' API allows any random person 
to delete the ENTIRE database, which is really bad if this database is to be used 
a lot or keeps useful/meaningful information.</li>
<li><span class="emph">Resolution: </span>There should be a 2 step security process 
added to the API. (1) Admin credentials are needed to use the API so that we can 
make sure it is an intentional deletion of the database. (2) There should be a 
confirmation step where we make sure that it is what the admin wants to do.</li>
</ul>

<li><h2>Access-Control-Allow-Origin '*'</h2></li>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">Location: </span>web.js</li>
<li><span class="emph">Severity: </span><span class="medium">MEDIUM</span> - 
Any site/user can use the app without checks</li>
<li><span class="emph">Description: </span>Since the app allows any web service 
or user to connect to the database, while that is a good thing, it leads the app 
to be open to users that might hold malicious intent that will easily toy with 
the database APIs and try to find ways to break it.</li>
<li><span class="emph">Resolution: </span>There are some things that can make it 
harder for those bad apples such as having authentication of users that are actually 
going to use the app for good purposes, or we can implement the app such that only 
certain sites/domains have access to the database and that site can delegate who/what 
can connect to the database, in other words, a middle man that filters out certain 
users.</li>
</ul>

<li><h2>Insecure user input field</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">Location: </span>web.js</li>
<li><span class="emph">Severity: </span><span class="high">HIGH</span> - 
Allows users too much freedom in the input box</li>
<li><span class="emph">Description: </span>The input text box for the '/usersearch' 
API allows for as many characters as the user desires, which is terrible since 
they can just type in whatever code they want to run and send it to the app.</li>
<li><span class="emph">Resolution: </span>The input box should be given a max 
number of allowed characters. This is fine since the search is on usernames and 
they shouldn't be much longer than 32 characters in the first place: 
[input type="text" name="textboxname" maxlength="32"]. This restriction 
will greatly help in securing the input that the user can give and there are other things 
that can also be done in order to secure the input box.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ol>


<a name="conclusion"></a><h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Most of the security faults found were in the web.js source code and specifically 
in the APIs that were allowed. But there are other security issues that might not 
have been found since we were only able to examine the source code.</p>
<p>Overall, the ideas and implementation of the ScoreCenter database is good and 
would be great to use if the APIs are a little more developed and also secured. 
Hopefully the app is relooked at and implemented a little more.</p>
